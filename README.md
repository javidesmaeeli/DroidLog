# DroidLog
A simple logging API for android which provides various tools.

### Add DriodLog to project
You need to make sure you have the JCenter repository included in the `build.gradle` file in the root of your project:

```
repositories {
    ...
    jcenter()
}
```

Next add a dependency in the `build.gradle` file of your app module.

```
implementation 'org.esmaeeli.droid:log:1.x.x'
```
